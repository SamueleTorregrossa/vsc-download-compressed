# vsc-download-compressed README

## Visual Studio Code Marketplace
You can find this extension on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samueletorregrossa.compress-download-extension).

## Features

This extension provides the following features:
- Download compressed files or directories from remote servers.

When connected to a remote SSH environment in Visual Studio Code, you can right-click on any file or directory in the Explorer context menu and select "Compress and Download". The extension will use `rsync` to transfer the selected item from the remote server to your local Downloads directory.

## Benefits

- **Up to 10x Faster**: This extension can be up to 10 times faster than the built-in VS Code "Download" functionality because it compresses the files before transferring them, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.60.0 or higher.
- A remote server accessible via SSH.
- `rsync` installed on both the local and remote machines.
- Proper SSH configuration to allow passwordless login to the remote server (using SSH keys).

## Installation

1. **Package the Extension**:
   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
   npm i --save-dev @types/jest
   npm install -g vsce
   vsce package
   ```

2. **Install the Extension**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Click on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and select "Install from VSIX...".
   - Select the generated `.vsix` file from the previous step.

## Extension Settings

This extension currently does not add any VS Code settings.

## Known Issues

- The extension is only available in SSH remote environments.
- Ensure that `rsync` is properly installed and configured on both local and remote machines.
